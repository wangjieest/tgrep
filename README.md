# tgrep

Trigram-indexed grep with a client/server architecture for fast regex search in
large codebases — as a command line tool, or as an MCP server that hands that
search to an AI agent.

> **This is a fork of [microsoft/tgrep](https://github.com/microsoft/tgrep).**
> Its default branch adds one thing: `tgrep mcp`, a Model Context Protocol
> server built for agents working in repositories too large to scan. Everything
> else is upstream tgrep. See [what this fork adds](#what-this-fork-adds) and
> **[MCP.md](MCP.md)**.

**tgrep is integrated into [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)
to power fast grep searches across large repositories.**

## Why?

Tools like `grep` and `ripgrep` scan every file on every search — O(total bytes)
per query. In a 100k+ file monorepo, that's painfully slow. tgrep pre-builds a
trigram index so searches only touch the small set of files that could match.

**Start a server once, search instantly forever.**

```bash
tgrep index .            # build the trigram index
tgrep serve .            # start server (watches for file changes)
tgrep "fn main" .        # instant — auto-connects to running server
```

## What this fork adds

`tgrep mcp <repo>` serves one repository over the Model Context Protocol on
stdio. It starts a `tgrep serve` for the tree, or adopts one already running, so
an agent gets indexed search without anyone managing a daemon — and the server
it starts dies with it.

```bash
claude mcp add tgrep -- tgrep mcp /path/to/repo
```

| Tool | For |
|------|-----|
| `search` | Regex or literal search, with context lines |
| `count_matches` | Per-file match counts — size a query before paying for its output |
| `search_files` | Find files by path, glob or type |
| `index_status` | Whether answers are indexed or scanned; wait for a build to finish |
| `snapshot_create` / `snapshot_diff` | Record the tree's state, then report what changed since |

Three things it does that wrapping the CLI in a tool definition does not:

- **It budgets its output.** 60 matches by default, 10 per file, 512-byte lines
  — and a truncated answer still reports the true totals plus where the rest of
  the matches are, so narrowing the query is a decision rather than a guess.
- **It says what answered.** Every result carries `index: {state, server}`:
  `indexed`, `building` or `scanning`. An agent can tell a 200 ms indexed answer
  from a filesystem scan, and knows how fresh either one is.
- **It refuses the trap.** On a 371,547-file checkout, building the first index
  took 97.6 s, while one whole-tree scan issued before that index existed ran
  for over 12 minutes. Until the index is ready, a whole-repository content
  search is refused with instructions for waiting instead of an answer that may
  never arrive.

Measured through the MCP tools on that same checkout once indexed: a literal
symbol search across 540 files answers in 263 ms, per-file counts over 11,738
files in 1.2 s, and a metadata snapshot of all 371,626 files in 2.2 s.

Snapshots are the other half. `snapshot_create` records size, mtime and precise
change evidence per file without reading any content; `snapshot_diff` then
reports what was added, modified, deleted or renamed since — and with
`hash: true` it can tell a file whose bytes really changed from one whose
timestamp merely moved. Full semantics, costs and limits: [MCP.md](MCP.md).

### Benchmark highlights (avg latency per query, index pre-built)

| Repo | Files | Platform | ripgrep | tgrep | Speedup |

tgrep wins 17 of the 18 measured cells; the exception is Kubernetes on Linux, a
near-tie at 0.93x. The margin depends on repo size and on how many matches a query
returns — a search that returns tens of thousands of matches spends more on
delivering them than the index saves on finding them. See
[What decides the margin](BENCHMARKS.md#what-decides-the-margin).

## Architecture

```
tgrep <pattern> ---TCP---> tgrep serve (multi-client)
    (client)                   |
                          HybridIndex
                          /         \
                   IndexReader    LiveIndex
                   (mmap disk)   (in-memory overlay)
                        ^              ^
                        |              |
                  Periodic Flush  File Watcher (notify)
                  (50K files /    Background Indexer
                   5 min)         (rayon parallel)
```

- **IndexReader** — mmap'd on-disk index (zero-copy, binary search on sorted
  trigram lookup table)
- **LiveIndex** — in-memory overlay for files modified after server start, or
  being built by the background indexer
- **HybridIndex** — merges both layers; overlay takes precedence
- **Background Indexer** — builds the index in parallel batches of 1,024 files
  (with additional byte-based splitting); resumed partial indexes use batches of
  500 files. Clients scan until complete hidden-file coverage is published
- **Periodic Flush** — every 50K files or 5 minutes, the in-memory index is
  flushed to disk and the reader is swapped, keeping memory bounded
- **Automatic refresh** — native `notify` subscriptions update LiveIndex in
  real time when available; budget or registration failures switch to polling
- **Filename Index** — `--files` unions content-index paths with a compact
  sidecar containing only admitted paths that have no searchable content
- **TCP Server** — JSON-RPC 2.0 over newline-delimited TCP; each connection
  handled in a separate thread; multiple clients can connect simultaneously
- **File Cache** — 50K-entry content cache with RwLock for lock-free reads

## Performance

tgrep is designed to be significantly faster than ripgrep on large repos:

- **Parallel search** — candidate files are searched in parallel using rayon
- **Fast query planning** — sorted posting lists are intersected/unioned without
  unnecessary resorting, and on-disk posting lists skip redundant deduplication
- **Memory-efficient full builds** — index builds batch extraction and stream
  sorted postings, file entries, and lookup entries instead of retaining the full
  inverted index in memory
- **Smart file walking** — extension-based binary rejection (50+ formats) and an
  8KB content check, with a 64 MiB size cap on both indexing and searching
  (`--no-max-filesize` removes it)
- **Lock-free reads** — `RwLock<HashMap>` cache allows concurrent reads
  without contention
- **Hot serving** — queries work immediately during background index building,
  falling back to filesystem scans until the index is ready

See [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) for end-to-end large-repo benchmarks and
Criterion microbenchmarks for query execution, trigram extraction, and index
building.

## Usage

### Build the index

```bash
tgrep index .                          # index current directory
tgrep index /path/to/repo             # index a specific repo
tgrep index . --index-path /tmp/idx   # custom index location
tgrep index . --exclude vendor --exclude third_party  # skip directories
```

Each build reports its elapsed time and peak memory when it finishes:

```
Index built successfully at /tmp/idx
Indexed in 22.6s using external strategy (peak memory 160.1 MiB)
```

The peak is the memory the process itself holds — private/committed bytes, not
resident set. The two differ once large files are memory-mapped: mapped pages are
file-backed and reclaimable, so counting them would report the size of the files
being indexed rather than tgrep's own use. Indexing a single 2 GiB file holds
77.8 MiB while its working set reaches 1.99 GiB. When the working set is
substantially larger it is named alongside, so nothing is hidden:

```
Indexed in 46.1s using external strategy (peak memory 77.8 MiB private, 1.99 GiB working set incl. memory-mapped files)
```

#### Repositories without a `.git` directory

`.gitignore` files only take effect inside a git repository. This matches
ripgrep, which gates them the same way, but it surprises people indexing a
Perforce, Source Depot, or plain-directory enlistment: the root `.gitignore` is
read by nothing, and the only symptom is an index far larger than expected.

tgrep says so rather than leaving you to guess:

```
Walking /src/enlistment...
warning: /src/enlistment has a .gitignore but is not a git repository, so it is
not applied (this matches ripgrep). Pass --no-require-git to apply it.
Found 290018 text files (2893 binary skipped, 0 too large, 0 errors)
```

`--no-require-git` applies the rules anyway, and works on `index`, `serve`, and
search alike, so the index and your queries agree on which files exist:

```bash
tgrep index . --no-require-git
tgrep serve --no-require-git
```

#### Case-insensitive repositories

When git clones onto a filesystem that does not distinguish case — which on
Windows is every clone — it sets `core.ignorecase` and stops distinguishing case
when it matches ignore rules. A rule spelled `QLogs` then hides a directory
named `qlogs`.

Most tools, ripgrep included, always match ignore rules case-sensitively, so
that directory is walked, read and indexed even though `git status` never
mentions it. On one Windows enlistment that was a single 13.4 GiB build
artifact, 71% of the corpus, adding about 16 seconds to *every* query.

tgrep reads `core.ignorecase` and matches the way the repository itself does.
Files git **tracks** are exempt, which is git's own rule — ignore rules only
decide the fate of files git does not already know about. Without that
exemption the same change would have hidden 273 tracked `.JPG`, `.PNG` and
`.RLL` files caught by rules written in lower case.

On that enlistment the walk went from listing one file more than
`git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` to matching it exactly, at a
cost of roughly 0.4 s on a 293k-file walk. `--no-ignore` turns it off along with
every other ignore source, and repositories that distinguish case are unaffected
and pay nothing.

Only the repository's own root `.gitignore` and `.git/info/exclude` are matched
this way. Rules in nested `.gitignore` files are not, because the walk does not
know they exist until it reaches their directory. Missing one only leaves a file
visible that git would hide, which is what every other tool does anyway.

#### Keep `index` and `serve` flags in step

Flags that decide *which files belong in the index* — `--no-require-git`,
`--no-ignore`, `--max-filesize`, `--exclude` — must match between the `tgrep
index` that built an index and the `tgrep serve` that serves it.

The server compares the index against the filesystem at startup and treats an
indexed file it cannot see as deleted. So serving an index built without a cap
under a `--max-filesize 8M` server drops every file above 8 MiB from that index,
permanently. Both sides default to 64 MiB, so this only bites when one side
names a limit; pass the same flags to both:

```bash
tgrep index . --max-filesize 8M
tgrep serve   --max-filesize 8M
```

#### Memory use on very large repos

Builds default to `--index-strategy=external`, which bounds peak memory with an
external merge sort: postings accumulate in a fixed-size arena that spills
sorted, compact segments to disk when full, and the segments are k-way merged
straight into the index. Peak memory is roughly flat in repo size rather than
linear.

If the arena never fills, nothing is spilled and the build takes exactly the
in-memory path, so small and mid-size repos pay nothing for this default.

```bash
tgrep index .                                 # external, 64 MB arena
tgrep index . --index-buffer 16               # smaller arena, lower peak
tgrep index . --index-strategy=memory         # opt out: sort entirely in RAM
```

On the Linux kernel (94,634 files, 990 MiB index), measured under the 1 MiB
indexing cap that was the default at the time, the default strategy is a **~17x
reduction in peak memory, and no slower**:

| Strategy | Spill segments | Peak working set | Build |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `external` (default, 64 MiB arena) | 31 | **160.1 MiB** | 22.6 s |
| `external --index-buffer 16` | 122 | 109.6 MiB | ~23 s |
| `memory` | - | 2.20 - 3.76 GiB | 23 - 32 s |

`--index-buffer` trades peak memory against merge fan-in. Bounded memory is also
*predictable* memory — the `memory` row varied by over a gigabyte across
identical runs because `Vec` growth doubles and both buffers are briefly
resident during the final reallocation, while `external` varied by 8 MiB.

The 1 MiB indexing cap those rows were measured under is now 64 MiB, and files
past 1 MiB are memory-mapped rather than read onto the heap. On the same repo the
`external` build now settles at roughly **152 MiB of private memory in 27 s**,
against 197-200 MiB and 41-42 s when every admitted file was read onto the heap.
The arena bound is unchanged; what changed is that a handful of 20 MB generated
headers no longer cost their full size in heap in every worker that touches one.
The 152 MiB figure was taken with no cap at all, and the 64 MiB default excludes
only files *above* 64 MiB, so it leaves these numbers alone here: the largest file
in the kernel tree is a 22.9 MiB generated AMD register header, and nothing in its
95,862 files reaches the cap.

Two caveats on reading those numbers. The peak tgrep prints is *private bytes*,
which excludes mapped file pages, so it reports what the process actually holds
rather than the size of the files it is reading — the same build is 152 MiB
private against ~192 MiB resident, and the working set is named alongside only
when it is substantially larger, as in [Build the index](#build-the-index).
macOS is the exception: `libc` does not surface the Mach counter that separates
the two, so it still reports resident set there. And a very large file that is
neither valid UTF-8 nor detectably binary still costs about its own size, because
the index has to hold the same repaired bytes a search will match against; a
135 MB Latin-1 file indexes at roughly 205 MiB.

Pass `--max-filesize` if a build has to fit a tighter budget, or
`--no-max-filesize` to lift the 64 MiB default entirely.

`--index-strategy=memory` remains available as an escape hatch for environments
where spilling is undesirable or impossible, such as a read-only or full index
volume. Both strategies produce byte-identical indexes from the same walk —
note that file IDs follow walk order, which the parallel walker does not fix
between runs, so two builds of the same tree need not be byte-identical to each
other. See
[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md#index-build-strategies) for full numbers.

`tgrep serve` uses the same bounded builder when it has to create an index from
scratch, so starting a server on an unindexed repo costs the same memory as
`tgrep index` (**148.6 MiB** rather than 1.6 GiB on the Linux kernel, and 2.6x
faster). While that first build runs, clients fall back to filesystem scans
rather than returning partial results; incremental updates after it completes
are unaffected.

### Start the server

```bash
tgrep serve .                          # start server (auto-builds index if missing)
tgrep serve . --index-path /tmp/idx    # custom index location
tgrep serve . --watch-mode poll        # poll without any native subscriptions
tgrep serve . --poll-interval 60       # polling cadence after fallback
tgrep serve . --watch-budget 4096      # lower this process's native watch ceiling
tgrep serve . --no-watch              # disable all automatic refresh
tgrep serve . --exclude node_modules   # exclude directories from indexing
```

The server builds the index in the background if none exists and resumes
incomplete builds. Clients scan the filesystem until the full corpus is ready;
`tgrep status` reports indexing progress and hidden-file coverage. Legacy
indexes are upgraded by startup reconciliation. Multiple clients can connect
simultaneously.

On Windows, replaced index generations remain under the index directory's
`.retired` folder while readers still have them memory-mapped. Cleanup uses
non-POSIX deletion so mapped files are not unlinked into NTFS's `$Deleted`
namespace. The server retries cleanup after publication, every minute even
when idle, and on startup. Only generations with a committed marker are
automatically removed; uncommitted backups are preserved for recovery.
This prevents new orphaned generations; it does not reclaim storage already
stranded in `$Deleted` by an older version.

Resource use during that initial build can be tuned. These apply to both
`tgrep serve` and `tgrep index`:

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `--max-memory <MB>` | 50% of RAM (512 MB–16 GB) | Flush to disk once the in-memory index exceeds this, bounding peak memory |
| `--max-cpu <PERCENT>` | `50` | Confine parallel reading and trigram extraction to this share of logical cores |
| `--auto-save-mutations <N>` | `5000` | Accumulated index changes that trigger a background save; higher means fewer pauses but more to redo if killed |
| `--watcher-queue-cap <N>` | `16384` | Filesystem events buffered between the OS watcher and the indexing worker; raise it if bulk changes log watcher queue overflows, since each overflow forces a full stale check |

#### Staying in step with the filesystem

Automatic refresh has two modes, configured on `tgrep serve`:

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `--watch-mode <auto\|poll>` | `auto` | Prefer native notifications with polling fallback, or use polling only |
| `--poll-interval <SECONDS>` | `120` | Wait after each polling reconciliation completes; range 1-86400 |
| `--watch-budget <N>` | `8192` | Conservative process-local native watch ceiling; range 1-4294967295 |
| `--no-watch` | off | Disable all automatic refresh: native watching, polling, and periodic reconciliation |

In `auto` mode, exceeding the watch budget, exhausting OS watch capacity, or
another error preventing complete native coverage switches the **whole
process** to polling. Status retains the specific fallback reason. This fallback
is sticky until the server restarts: it releases only this process's native watches and
does not keep retrying native registration. `poll` mode starts with **zero
native subscriptions**, including on Linux. It uses tgrep's metadata
reconciliation, not a second native watcher or `notify::PollWatcher`.

The default budget of 8192 is a conservative ceiling, **not an estimate of
free per-user capacity**. On Linux the inotify quota is shared with other
processes running as the same user; they may consume capacity before this
server reaches its budget. Raising the budget does not raise that shared quota.
tgrep does not probe the configured Linux quota: it uses this fixed ceiling
and authoritative OS registration errors. The budget counts one subscription
per admitted directory on Linux/Android; recursive backends count their single
root subscription as one.

The event buffer controlled by `--watcher-queue-cap` is separate: queue overflow
triggers recovery reconciliation, not watch-budget fallback. Only create,
modify, and remove events enter this buffer; read-only access notifications
(including Linux directory-open events from tgrep's own walks) are discarded
before queueing. Native rescan notifications still trigger recovery.

Polling walks the admitted tree and checks metadata for additions, changes,
and deletions. Its default cadence is completion-based: the next poll waits
120 seconds after the previous reconciliation finishes. Actual freshness also
includes scan/update time (and any in-progress indexing or save); it is not a
120-second hard freshness guarantee. Searches do not defer polling, and slow
scans do not cause overlapping polls or catch-up storms.
Fallback does not hide failures: a failed polling reconciliation or unreadable
input remains unhealthy and is reported in status.

Native notifications can also go missing, for example on a network or
virtualised filesystem. Native mode therefore retains its safety
reconciliation: about once an hour it walks the tree and compares it against
the index, waiting for a two-minute gap in queries and deferring no longer than
four hours. `--poll-interval` sets the polling cadence, not this native safety
cadence.

No-change metadata scans leave the index untouched; they do not rewrite it.
A changed delta merge may still rewrite the whole on-disk index. On Linux,
nanosecond mtime and ctime plus file identity detect ordinary writes even when
the modification timestamp is restored. Other OS/filesystem metadata
limitations remain: changes that preserve all available evidence may be
missed. A scan and its updates do not provide an atomic filesystem snapshot.

`--no-watch` still permits the initial build/startup reconciliation, but turns
off all subsequent automatic refresh. It cannot be combined explicitly with
`--watch-mode`, `--poll-interval`, or `--watch-budget`. Explicit
`--watch-mode poll` also rejects `--watch-budget`, since polling uses no native
watches. Inherited default values do not cause conflicts.

On Linux and Android, tgrep registers only the non-ignored directories with
inotify, avoiding watch-descriptor growth beneath ignored trees. This guarantee
is backend-specific: the implementation intentionally keeps one recursive
`ReadDirectoryChangesW` root subscription on Windows and one root FSEvents
stream on macOS, where ignored events are filtered after delivery and ignored
descendants remain watched. kqueue and `PollWatcher` are not covered.

### Search

```bash
tgrep "pattern" .                 # basic regex search
tgrep "pattern" file1.rs file2.rs # search multiple files/paths
tgrep "TODO|FIXME" .              # alternations
tgrep '\w+(?!_test)' .            # PCRE-style lookahead fallback
tgrep "error" . -i                # case-insensitive
tgrep "error" . -S                # smart-case (auto if all lowercase)
tgrep -F "Vec<T>" .               # literal string
tgrep "MyStruct" . -l             # filenames only
tgrep "pattern" . -c              # count per file
tgrep "pattern" . -o              # only matching text
tgrep "pattern" . -w              # whole word
tgrep "pattern" . -v              # invert match
tgrep "pattern" . -m 5            # max 5 matches per file
tgrep "pattern" . -g "*.rs"       # glob filter
tgrep "pattern" . -g "*.rs" -g "*.toml"  # multiple globs (OR)
tgrep "pattern" . -t rust         # type filter
tgrep "pattern" . -e "also_this"  # multiple patterns
tgrep "pattern" . -A 3            # 3 lines after match
tgrep "pattern" . -B 2            # 2 lines before match
tgrep "pattern" . -C 3            # 3 lines before & after
tgrep "pattern" . --json          # ripgrep-compatible JSON stream
tgrep "pattern" . --vimgrep       # vim-compatible output
tgrep "pattern" . --stats         # show query plan & timing
tgrep "pattern" . --no-index      # brute-force (skip index)
tgrep "pattern" . -U              # multiline matching
tgrep "pattern" . -q              # quiet: exit code only
tgrep "pattern" . --files-without-match  # files that DON'T match
tgrep "pattern" . --no-filename   # suppress filenames
tgrep "pattern" . -N              # suppress line numbers
tgrep --files .                   # list searchable files
tgrep --files src/main.rs         # list a single file if searchable
tgrep --files -t rust .           # list Rust files only
tgrep --type-list                 # show all file types
```

With the default traversal rules, `--files` reads the live server or the local
index instead of walking the repository. The local result is an index snapshot;
use `--no-index` to inspect the filesystem as it exists now. Flags that change
traversal membership or the file-size policy also fall back to a walk.

### Serve to an AI agent (MCP)

```bash
tgrep mcp .                            # MCP server on stdio
tgrep mcp . --no-auto-index            # never build or start a server
```

Exposes indexed search, per-file match counts, file listing, index state and
folder snapshots/diffs as MCP tools, and starts a server for the repository
unless one is already running. See [MCP.md](MCP.md).

### Check status

```bash
tgrep status .
```

Server status for /src/my-monorepo
  PID:        37980
  Port:       51043
  Files:      152
  Trigrams:   12265
  Cache:      2/50000
  Watcher:    active
  Watch mode: native (requested: auto)
  Watch budget: 8192
  Poll interval: 120s (after completion)
  Reconcile:  idle
  Last successful reconcile: 2m ago
  Reconcile pending: no
  Reconcile overdue: no
  Last reconcile duration: 42ms
  Indexing:   complete
```

Status retains the native `Watcher` indicator and reports the requested mode
(`auto`, `poll`, or `disabled`) and active mode (`native`, `poll`, `disabled`,
or `starting`). A polling server normally shows an inactive native watcher.
Fallback reasons, the last successful reconciliation, the latest attempt's
duration/error, and whether reconciliation is running, pending, or overdue help
distinguish a healthy polling server from one that has stopped refreshing.
Pending means catch-up work is requested; overdue means that work is pending
or the polling interval/native safety deadline has elapsed since completion.
Older servers without these fields still display their existing status.

### Count files

```bash
tgrep count-files .              # count text files (no server needed)
tgrep count-files /path/to/repo  # scan a specific repo
```

Prints the count to stdout (scriptable) and details to stderr:

```
284957
284957 text files (47516 binary skipped, 0 errors) in 1200ms
```

| `--sort-files` | Shorthand for `--sort path` |
| `--line-buffered` / `--block-buffered` | Force line- or block-buffered stdout |

**Encoding**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-E, --encoding <LABEL>` | Decode files as `LABEL` (e.g. `utf-16le`, `latin1`, `sjis`), or `none` for raw bytes |
| `--no-encoding` | Restore BOM-sniffing auto-detection |

By default tgrep sniffs a UTF-8/UTF-16LE/UTF-16BE BOM and decodes accordingly,
so BOM-marked UTF-16 files are searched as text rather than reported as binary.
A BOM always wins over `-E`, matching ripgrep. Because the index is built with
auto-detection, an explicit `-E` bypasses the index and server and searches
files directly, so results stay correct.

| `--no-ignore-messages` | Suppress errors about malformed ignore files |
| `--no-require-git` | Apply git ignore rules outside a git repository |
| `-j, --threads <N>` | Number of search threads |

**Accepted for compatibility**

`--mmap`/`--no-mmap` (tgrep always reads files directly), `--crlf`/`--no-crlf`
(a trailing `\r` is always stripped), `--no-config` (tgrep reads no config
file), and `--colors <SPEC>` (colors are not yet configurable) are accepted and
ignored so ripgrep command lines keep working. `--debug`/`--trace` imply
`--stats`.

`-z/--search-zip` is **not** supported and exits with code `2` rather than
silently reporting no matches in compressed files.

> **Note:** `-L` means `--follow` (as in ripgrep). Use the long
> `--files-without-match` for the non-matching-files listing.

### Patterns and paths

Without `-e`/`-f`, the first positional argument is the pattern and the rest are
paths. As soon as `-e` or `-f` supplies a pattern, **every** positional becomes
a path, matching ripgrep:

```bash
tgrep -e needle .            # searches for "needle" under .
tgrep -e needle -e other .   # both patterns, still just one path
```

### Output defaults

tgrep matches ripgrep's context-dependent defaults rather than fixed ones:

- **Line numbers** are on only when stdout is a terminal. Piping to another
  command drops them, so `tgrep needle . | cut -d: -f1` behaves the same as it
  does with ripgrep. `--column`, `--vimgrep` and `-p` turn them back on;
  `-b` and `-A/-B/-C` do not.
- **Filenames** are shown unless you named exactly one *file*. A directory
  argument always shows them. `-H`/`-I` override either way.
- **Paths** are printed by appending onto the argument you typed: the argument
  survives verbatim and only the appended part uses the platform separator. So
  `tgrep needle src/` prints `src/main.rs` while `tgrep needle src` prints
  `src\main.rs` on Windows. `--path-separator` rewrites every separator.

### Match limits

`-m/--max-count` limits matching *lines*, as ripgrep does, not individual
matches. A line holding several matches spends one unit of the budget and all
of its matches are still reported, so `tgrep -m1 --vimgrep foo` prints one row
per match on the first matching line. Under `-U/--multiline` the unit is the
contiguous block of lines a match covers, which keeps a match that straddles a
line boundary whole instead of truncating it mid-pattern.

One divergence: ripgrep stops reading a file once the limit is reached, so its
`--stats` `bytes_searched` is lower than tgrep's, which searches from a
whole-file buffer. The match counts themselves agree.

### Multiline matches

`-U/--multiline` lets a match cross line boundaries, and every line a match
covers is printed. `--vimgrep` is the exception: it reports one row per match
so editors get one jump target each, so a match spanning several lines is
reported only on the line it starts on.

Two divergences, both cases where ripgrep names a column that doesn't exist on
the line it prints — `rg -U --column` reports the same column for every line of
a match, and `rg -U --vimgrep -o` can report column 19 of a 7-character line.
tgrep reports the real match position instead.

### Binary files

A file is binary if it contains a NUL byte. Following ripgrep:

- Binary files found by walking a directory are **skipped silently** — they
  appear in neither the output, `-l`, `-c`, nor `--files-without-match`.
- A binary file **named explicitly** on the command line reports a note:
  `bin.dat: binary file matches (found "\0" byte around offset 7)`.
- `--binary` promotes traversal to the explicit behaviour, so binary files are
  searched and summarised with that note.
- `-a`/`--text` disables binary detection entirely and prints matches as text.
- `--json` has no note. As in ripgrep, the matching lines are emitted as
  ordinary `match` events and the file's `end` message carries
  `binary_offset` — the offset of the first NUL — so a consumer can still tell
  a binary hit apart from a text one. `stats.bytes_searched` stops at that
  offset rather than counting the whole file.

tgrep additionally rejects ~65 binary file *extensions* during the walk to keep
indexing cheap, which ripgrep does not do. `--binary` and `-a` also lift that
restriction, and `--files` never applies it.

### Flags that bypass the index

`index` and `serve` include hidden, **non-ignored** files by default.
`--hidden` is accepted on either command but is redundant. Ordinary queries
still hide hidden files and directories; `-./--hidden` includes them using the
index or server, for content searches and `--files`. Visibility is relative to
the requested search root and includes Windows hidden attributes. Ignore rules
inside hidden directories remain active. The configured index directory,
including its staging and retired generations, is always excluded from indexing
and query filesystem walks.

Flags that widen or re-interpret the indexed corpus still walk the tree:
`-E/--encoding`, `-a/--text`, `--binary`, every `--no-ignore*` variant, and
positive `--glob`/`--iglob` overrides, which can explicitly reinclude ignored
files. Negative-only globs, such as `--glob '!.git'`, remain index-compatible
and exclude entire matching directory subtrees. `--hidden` never disables
ignore rules. Naming a single file also skips the index, since reading one
file directly is cheaper than loading one.

Legacy indexes without proven hidden-file coverage and incomplete builds fall
back to a filesystem scan, rather than returning partial results. Run
`tgrep index` to rebuild, or start a current `tgrep serve` to reconcile and
upgrade an existing index automatically. Queries keep scanning until coverage
is established. A current client also falls back when an older server cannot
confirm that capability. As before, a completed on-disk index is a snapshot,
not a guarantee that later filesystem changes have been indexed.

New indexes use a versioned file table and filename sidecar so older clients
cannot silently expose hidden files by ignoring visibility metadata. Older
binaries reject the new local content index; filename listing can fall back to
walking. New binaries still read older formats to migrate them. To downgrade,
rebuild with the older binary, preferably at a separate `--index-path`.
Visibility is bound to the path table, and filename-only membership is
published together with its visibility; mismatched generations fall back to
scanning rather than guessing.

### Invalid UTF-8

ripgrep searches raw bytes. tgrep decodes first, repairing any undecodable byte
into a `U+FFFD`, which is what makes the trigram index possible. Reported
positions are mapped back, so `--column`, `-b`, `--vimgrep` and `-r` all report
the byte offsets on disk exactly as ripgrep does. Two differences remain on
lines that are not valid UTF-8:

- A pattern can match the substituted `U+FFFD`; ripgrep, seeing raw bytes, never
  matches there. So `tgrep '.' ` finds one more match per repaired byte.
- `--json` always reports `lines.text` with the substitutions in place, and
  submatch offsets that index it. ripgrep instead emits `lines.bytes` as base64
  and reports source offsets. `absolute_offset` is a real file offset either
  way.

### File size limits

Searching and indexing both skip files larger than **64 MiB** by default. This
is a deliberate divergence from ripgrep, which has no default limit.

The divergence is affordable because tgrep is not a one-shot scanner. A file a
walk picks up is also a file the index carries and re-reads on every query whose
trigrams make it a candidate, so an outlier's cost is paid repeatedly rather
than once. On a 292,911-file enlistment where one 13.41 GiB generated build
artifact was 71% of all searchable bytes, the cap cut a cold index build from
214.5 s to 64.2 s and a warm query from 21.30 s to 0.55 s — a 39x difference —
at the cost of one match in one generated file, and it excluded 2 files out of
292,911.

The cost is real: an oversized file is counted but its path is never recorded,
so a match inside one is reported as no match. Two rules keep that from being
silent:

- `--no-max-filesize` restores the uncapped, ripgrep-identical behaviour, and
  `--max-filesize` sets a different bound.
- A file named directly on the command line is never dropped by the *inherited*
  default, only by a limit you passed. `tgrep pattern ./huge.log` searches
  `huge.log`.

The limit is resolved once, before the walk and the search diverge, so an index
and the queries against it always agree on which files exist. A walk that capped
where the search did not would be indistinguishable from "this file contains no
match".

The cap is not what bounds memory. Files past 1 MiB are memory-mapped during
both indexing and searching, so their pages are file-backed and reclaimable, and
mapped files are batched by what they actually put on the heap rather than by
their length — so a build over large files fills its worker pool instead of
running two files at a time. Combined with a faster trigram extractor, that made
indexing a tree of 32 MiB source files about 14x faster. Nor is size a good
proxy for *index* cost: oversized files are overwhelmingly generated and
therefore repetitive, contributing far fewer distinct trigrams per byte than
ordinary source. What the cap buys is bounded *scan* time. See
[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

### Exit codes

Same as ripgrep:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | At least one match was found |
| `1` | No matches |
| `2` | An error occurred (e.g. a path could not be read) |

A match plus an error yields `2`, unless `-q` is set, which yields `0`.

An ignore file that fails to parse is *not* one of these errors. Like ripgrep,
tgrep reports it on stderr, skips the offending rule and carries on, leaving the
exit code determined by the search alone. Suppress the message with
`--no-ignore-messages`, or with `--no-messages`, which covers it as well.

## How It Works

1. **Indexing** — walks the repo (respecting `.gitignore` and root-level
   `p4ignore.ini`), skips binary files
   by extension (50+ formats) and content check (first 8KB), extracts all
   overlapping 3-byte trigrams from each text file in parallel (rayon), and
   writes a compact binary inverted index. Full builds stream sorted posting
   groups directly to disk to keep peak memory bounded.

2. **Querying** — the regex is parsed with `regex-syntax`, decomposed into
   literal fragments, converted to trigram hashes, and looked up via binary
   search in the mmap'd index. Posting lists are intersected (AND) or
   unioned (OR) to find candidate files, reusing sorted posting-list order when
   possible. Only those candidates are verified with the full regex engine in
   parallel (rayon).

3. **Serving** — `tgrep serve` wraps the index in a HybridIndex, watches for
   filesystem changes, and serves queries over TCP. If no index exists, it
   builds one in the background (batches of 1,024 files, split sooner by byte
   budgets); clients scan until complete coverage is published, including when
   resuming a partial index;
   after the initial build, pending changes are auto-saved when 5,000 content mutations accumulate by default, or on the first periodic check at least 10 minutes after startup or the last successful save. Multiple clients connect simultaneously;

   searches use read locks for zero contention.

## On-Disk Format

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `lookup.bin` | Sorted 16-byte entries: `trigram(u32) + offset(u64) + length(u32)` |
| `index.bin` | Concatenated posting lists: `file_id(u32)` per entry |
| `files.bin` | Version 3 header, then `file_id(u32) + path_len(u16) + path_bytes`; legacy headerless tables remain readable |
| `files-extra.bin` | Version 2 filename-only paths, visibility, and file-table identity |
| `meta.json` | Version, file/trigram counts, timestamps, coverage, visibility, and file-table identity |
| `serve.json` | Server PID and TCP port (for client discovery) |
